# /mis------.
Contains a script and the data for some of its features, made for an [Our World of Text](https://owot.me) world of the same name as this repository.

The script also uses modules from [owot-funbox](https://github.com/LimeSlime888/owot-funbox).

When run in the world, the typed text will adjust automatically to the environment, and deleting text will reveal a background.

Trying to hover over a link with the text cursor will also send you to its location and place your cursor there automatically.
